**Note:** Submit a pdf file via the Canvas assignment page
`Homework 1 <https://canvas.uw.edu/courses/962872/assignments/2829773>`_.

- `hw1.pdf <_static/hw1.pdf>`_

- See :ref:`hwformat` for a discussion of formatting.  Please use latex if
  possible for the analytical questions.

- If you want to use latex for your solutions, you can start with the file
  `hw1.tex`, which includes commented-out sections where you can insert
  solutions.  This can be found in the class repository (after cloning and
  perhaps doing a `git pull`, see :ref:`class_repos`) 
  as `$AM586/homeworks/hw1/hw1.tex`.
